gluon-au-change
===============

This package changes the autoupdater branch to stable on each update.

It should be used only for a short period of time. 

For example in case in your community you have to reset a lot of routers
back to the stable branch due to a time, where some new not completely supported
router models had to be installed with the experimental firmware.
